# Uno Clone

This is a very simple clone of Uno, the card game, hastily put together. As it stands, rules are not enforced, which allows for house rules!

## Build

In order to build this game, you will need to install the open source game engine, Godot ([official website](godotengine.org)). You then need to open the root folder as a project in Godot, and go to Project -> Export. You will also need the export templates for Godot (on their website too) in order to have any options. Now you can pick Add, and pick the platform of choice. The default settings should work out of the box.

## Install

Don't! Keep it in userspace. While I am fairly confident there are no vulnerabilities in my code, I am not 100% sure. For this reason, don't install it systemwide unless you acknowledge the risks!
